# single-transferable-vote

Counting the votes in the single transferable vote system is quite complicated, and often too tedious to do by hand. This is especially hard when a quota is used. That's why it's nice to have a simple tool to do it for you!

This project is meant to be compiled using the Mill build tool for Scala.
